    <h1>George Fox Changed My Life</h1>
    <div class="body">
      <p>It’s cheating a bit to say that George Fox University is the main thing that changed my life, because a more accurate way to say what I mean is my life changed a lot while at (and partially because of) Fox. I also don’t think it’s entirely fair to think college changing my life is a unique perspective because that’s what college is for. However, there are a few ways Fox has affected my life that are unique.
</p>
      <h2>Computer Science VS. English: The Showdown</h2>
      <p>BMy undergraduate degree will be a bachelor of science in computer science with a minor in writing, but I started my undergraduate as an English major, hoping to go into editing work because of my love of technical grammar. Because most editing is done online these days, I was encouraged to take the introduction to computer science class. This started a college career living my life between writing scripts in languages like C and Perl and writing long essays for honors and writing classes. Have I started three blogs, or four blogs now? I’ve lost count.
      </p>
      <p>Being an avid reader and a decent grammarian, I have loved learning about language through the lens of computer science and functional thinking. As I graduate this semester, I keep finding myself grateful that I got to study something so challenging and so different from my typical interests, since computer science is not something I could have learned on my own time.</p>
      <h2>Computer Science-1, English-0</h2>
      <p>The only deficiency with the English program at GFU is there are no serious grammar classes, and I quickly discovered that emotional interpretation of literature was more encouraged (or perhaps more prominent) than analytical interpretation. I can honestly say that I learned more grammar in 8th grade than I did in the collegiate level grammar class at Fox, and many of my peers in English would agree.
</p>
      <h2>Take Me to Church</h2>
      <p>Everyone at Fox complains about chapel. The required services at 10:50 every Tuesday vary widely in topic and focus, but usually include a short worship session and a guest speaker. I remember some of the speakers having questionable theology, and just like everyone else I thought chapel was a bit annoying. However, the required chapel was one of the reasons I came to George Fox. 
</p>
      <p>I knew that I wanted to live my life for God, but I also knew that my self discipline going into college was low and my relationship with God was weak. Having Christian professors, Christian books as part of class homework, and Christian worship all over campus was immensely wonderful to me, and I credit the Christian atmosphere at Fox for inspiring me to start going back to church.
</p>
      <p>I started out attending a Catholic church with one of my friends, which I really enjoyed because of its formality and routine. There’s nothing quite like Catholicism in the Protestant world. Then I started going to Newberg Friends Church with my best friend, which was also amazing! Their worship was so joyful and beautiful to listen to. Now I’m a member at a baptist church with my husband and I’m learning how to be a good church member as part of following Christ.
</p>
      <h2>Ring Way Before Spring</h2>
      <p>The best change that’s happened while I’ve been attending Fox is meeting and marrying my husband! I like to say that we met because I wanted someone to study with and it worked out a little too well (cut to us writing programs for the same class on the couch together in our own apartment), but really when I look back I can tell that I liked Nathaniel right away. We got married after nine months of dating in the middle of winter break in 2021.
</p>
      <p>After coming from freshly divorced parents with less than stable housing, working all the time to pay for school, and nearly sleepless nights, being married is 180 degrees in the opposite direction. Life is stable and I get way more sleep than I used to. My favorite person in the whole world sleeps beside me every night (and he makes me tea). And that is pretty awesome.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Not all of these are going to be things others relate with, but I hope you enjoyed reading some of the ways my life has changed at or because of George Fox University. And if you're a fellow student at George Fox, I hope this inspires you to think of ways that GFU has changed you!</p>
