    <h1>Using a Dumb Phone in 2023</h1>
    <div class="body">
      <p>About seven weeks ago, Nathaniel and I bought Nokia 2780 flip phones. We made the switch because we both dislike being attached to our smartphones and wanted to see how big of a change it was to switch. Here’s what I’ve learned.
</p>
      <h2>Initial Difficulties</h2>
      <p>The contacts were difficult to switch over manually because of the way the Nokia formats phone numbers, so I ended up needing to edit a large number of contacts even after importing them from my iPhone. That was annoying. The second annoying thing was that texting is significantly slower with a dumb phone, and I quickly made the change to calling someone whenever I had more to say than I could get across reasonably via text.
      </p>
      <p>So far, luckily, no one seems to mind being called.</p>
      <p>Two other things that I used to access daily on my phone, email for school correspondence and Discord for team project communication, suddenly became things I could only use my computer for. However, since I am actively on my computer every day, this ended up not being a big deal.
</p>
      <h2>Initial Benefits</h2>
      <p>I immediately noticed the difference in my day when I didn’t have a smart phone at school. The temptation to pull my phone out and look at it randomly became way lower, and my anxiety (raised from checking my phone) also lowered.</p>
      <p>The Nokia comes with T9 typing or predictive typing, which is like autocorrect but for a keypad. It suggests the word you are typing without the need to manually select every letter with multiple key presses. It’s very useful, and makes texting a bit faster once I figured out how to use it.</p>
      <p>Calling people is also a benefit, because it’s great to hear people’s voices and is actually a more effective way to communicate. In summary, the benefits are more ease of mind, predictive typing, and being forced to call people.</p>
      <p><br><br>After seven weeks, here are my current thoughts:
</p>
      <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>The camera quality is bad. There are times when I want to take a picture and show someone that picture, and what I’ve been doing is using my husband’s camera. The convenient camera on an iPhone is definitely something I miss and will have to get used to not having moving forward.
</p>
      <p>There have been occasions when being able to quickly check Discord while walking somewhere would have been convenient, but pulling out my computer to check is not.
</p>
      <p>Texting is still slow, but I’m getting used to it. I also generally say less over text at this point anyways, since I’m usually making plans with friends to actually see them.
</p>
      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <p>One thing that I have found rather interesting is that texting on my Nokia absorbs almost all of my attention, meaning that I almost can’t text and talk to someone at the same time. This realization made me subsequently realize that previously, I was texting and talking to someone in real life at the same time on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>I forget I even have a phone most of the time, because it just lives in the pocket of my coat and the only reason I need it at home is because of George Fox’s two factor authentication system. It’s honestly been a huge relief to not have my phone on me at all times, and have one less thing I can get sucked into or distracted by.
</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>I definitely wouldn’t recommend this to everyone. There are some great use cases for smartphones out there like video calling and taking good quality pictures and videos. However, this has been a really fun thing to do for me and something I will probably continue to do as part of my journey away from being addicted to technology.
